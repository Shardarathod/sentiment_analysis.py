Modeling: Training models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or deep learning models like LSTM, Transformers) to classify sentiment.

Evaluation: Measuring performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Prediction: Assigning sentiment labels to new text data.

 Applications:
Business: Analyzing customer feedback and product reviews.

Social Media: Monitoring public opinion and brand reputation.
